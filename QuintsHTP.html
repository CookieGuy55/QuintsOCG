                <h2>How to play</h2>
                <p>Quints is a back and forth card game where you want to be the first person to get 3 cards in your bride zone</p>
                <p>There are 5 zones you can play your cards in</p>
                <p>And there are 3 types of cards</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Characters</li>
                    <li>Episodes</li>
                    <li>Events</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can play 1 Character and 2 episodes each turn, and as many events as you are able to</p>
                <p>You get a bride in your bride zone by capturing one of the Futaro cards, "Get yo man" as Luke says</p>
                <p>To capture a Futaro card you must match or beat the power of the Futaro card</p>
                <p>Once you have captured a Futaro card, you put the character you attacked with into the bride zone, while discarding all attached cards, and do the effect of the Futaro card</p>
                <p>When you attack a Futaro card, your opponent has an opportunity to play events from their hand to weaken your attack. You can play events in responce to this and this goes on until someone wins or loses the lane</p>
                <p>You can attack more than one Futaro card per turn, so your opponent has to choose the right ones to stop</p>
