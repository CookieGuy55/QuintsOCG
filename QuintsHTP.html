                <h2>How to play</h2>
                <p>Quints is a back and forth card game where you want to be the first person to get 3 cards in your bride zone</p>
                <p>There are 5 zones you can play your cards in</p>
                <p>And there are 3 types of cards</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Characters</li>
                    <li>Episodes</li>
                    <li>Events</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can play 1 Character and 2 episodes each turn, and as many events as you are able to</p>
                <p>You get a bride in your bride zone by capturing one of the Futaro cards, "Get yo man" as Luke says</p>
                <p>To capture a Futaro card you must match or beat the power of the Futaro card</p>
                <p>Once you have captured a Futaro card, you put the character you attacked with into the bride zone, while discarding all attached cards, and do the effect of the Futaro card</p>
                <p>When you attack a Futaro card, your opponent has an opportunity to play events from their hand to weaken your attack. You can play events in responce to this and this goes on until someone wins or loses the lane</p>
                <p>You can attack more than one Futaro card per turn, so your opponent has to choose the right ones to stop</p>
                <h2>How to start the game</h2>
                <p>Play rock paper scissors to decide who goes first</p>
                <p>The winner of rock paper scissors goes first and the match proceeds with their Futaro deck</p>
                <p>Draw 5 cards for your starting hand, you get 1 mulligan (Put the 5 cards back in your deck, reshuffle and draw 5 new cards)</p>
                <p>Note: You do NOT draw any cards in the first start phase of the game (Player 1's first turn = No start phase draw)</p>

                <h2>Types of cards</h2>
                <h2>Characters</h2>
                <p>You can tell if a card is a character by the text in the top right that says [Character]</p>
                <p>Characters have a Character power in the top left</p>
                <p>Characters have an Episode power in the bottom left for when they are set to another character</p>
                <p>Characters also can have a chunk of text below the image which are the abilites of that character</p>
                <p>Example</p>
                <img src ="Yotsuba/Ch1.jpg" alt="logo" width="210" height="310">
                <h2>Episodes</h2>
                <p>Episodes can be identified by the text in the top right that says [Episode]</p>
                <p>Episodes only have an Episode power in the bottom left for when they are set to another character</p>
                <p>Episodes can not end up in the bride zone unless stated on the card</p>
                <p>Episodes also can have a block of text below the image which are the abilites to follow if you meet the conditions</p>
                <p>Example</p>
                <img src ="Yotsuba/Ep1.jpg" alt="logo" width="210" height="310">
                <h2>Events</h2>
                <p>Events are identified by the text in the top right that says [Event]</p>
                <p>Events do not have power and can not be played as Characters or set as Episodes</p>
                <p>Events are powerful because of their abilities that are in the block of text below the image</p>
                <p>Example</p>
